# Product Overview

Ghost Typing Defender is a tower defense typing game where players defend a haunted house from incoming families by typing words to scare them away. The game combines typing mechanics with strategic progression through a fright points economy and house upgrade system that scales difficulty alongside player power.

## Core Mechanics

- Type words to scare away families before they reach the house
- Earn fright points based on family size and word difficulty
- Purchase house upgrades that enhance power while increasing challenge
- Progress through waves with escalating difficulty
- Manage health as families that reach the house deal damage

## Visual Identity

The game uses a haunted house aesthetic with a flat, solid color palette centered on deep purples (#5B1391 core accent) against near-black backgrounds (#0A0A0D base). The visual style emphasizes atmosphere through high contrast, subtle animations, and retro pixel art with modern shadow discipline.
