# Technology Stack

## Framework Selection

This project is language-agnostic by design. The user chooses their preferred language and framework during initial setup. Common choices include:

- JavaScript/TypeScript with HTML5 Canvas or Phaser
- Python with Pygame
- Rust with Bevy or macroquad
- C# with Unity or MonoGame

## Development Philosophy

**Start Small, Build Smart** — Always begin with the simplest possible version that demonstrates core gameplay. Get a basic version working before adding polish or advanced features.

## Performance Targets

- Target 60 FPS for smooth gameplay
- Input processing within one frame for responsive typing
- No dropped keystrokes during rapid typing

## Common Workflow

Since the tech stack varies by user preference, common commands will depend on the chosen framework. After implementation begins, update this section with:

- Build commands
- Run/test commands
- Asset compilation steps
- Deployment process

## Audio and Visual Effects

Encourage creative use of:
- Particle effects (dust motes, supernatural glows)
- Subtle animations (flickers, pulses, breathing UI)
- Sound feedback for typing, scares, and upgrades
- Visual feedback for every game event
