My Game Visual Style — Haunted House Palette
Color Scheme

Use flat, solid colors. No gradients — just pure tone and atmosphere. Purples are deeper, colder, and spookier.

Primary Purples

Purple-500: #5B1391 — Core accent. Think supernatural glow on doors and cursed objects.

Purple-400: #7A27B8 — Hover and interactive accents.

Purple-300: #A469D6 — Lightest usable purple for text links and soft highlights.

Background Shadows

Shadow-900: #0A0A0D — Nearly-black base, subtle blue tint for that moonlit feel.

Shadow-800: #121219 — Secondary panels, eerie UI surfaces.

Shadow-700: #1D1C27 — Hover states on dark elements.

Shadow-600: #2A2837 — Card backgrounds, softer containers.

Text Colors

Fog-100: #FFFFFF — Primary text. Stands crisp on deep shadows.

Fog-300: #D0CCD7 — Secondary, muted.

Fog-400: #A6A1B2 — Labels, tertiary.

Usage Guidelines

Purple-500 is your “haunted highlight” — doors, sigils, key items, magical UI.

High contrast stays non-negotiable.

Use Shadow-900 as the game’s base canvas.

Purples are accents — like glints in the dark, not the whole room bathed in neon.

Color Application Examples

Primary buttons: bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-400

Links: text-purple-300 hover:text-purple-500

Cards on dark: bg-shadow-600 hover:bg-shadow-700

Body text: text-fog-100 or text-fog-300

Design Guidelines
Interaction

Soft but deliberate animations — UI feels like it breathes.

Feedback: flickers, whispers of motion, subtle particles drifting like dust motes.

Spacing should create tension — pockets of darkness where things could be.

Game Feel

Target 60 FPS — even ghosts deserve smooth motion.

Input should feel immediate and aware, like the game is listening in the dark.

Every event needs visual feedback — a flicker, a pulse, a small shudder.

Pixel art remains retro but with modern shadow discipline.

Still need your take on how gravity should behave.
